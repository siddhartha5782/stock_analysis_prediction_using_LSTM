# Stock Analysis and Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

This project implements stock price prediction using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, which are a type of **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** suitable for time series forecasting. LSTMs are ideal for stock market predictions as they capture the temporal dependencies in sequential data, making them effective in predicting future stock prices based on historical data.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize the stock price data for the model.
- **LSTM Model Implementation**: Build and train an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualize the predictions against actual stock prices.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Keras**: For building and training the LSTM model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras to run deep learning operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and performance evaluation.
